# Crazy Cat Adventures
A two-dimensional computer game written in C# and the MonoGame framework. The primary player (cat) must escape from its enemy (dog) and capture yarn balls as treasure. This is a computer game I've developed for Game Programming Techniques at the University of Canberra in Semester 1, 2019.
